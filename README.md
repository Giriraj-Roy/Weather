# Weather

A basic Weather page that shows weather report with a city as input or directly by letting access the location.

This project has been created using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

Application of OpenWeatherMap API which can be accessed here (https://openweathermap.org/api)

A first principle animation (haha!! Great joke and applauds) has also been added to the result of the display statement using Vanilla JS itself.
